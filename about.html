            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p> Hi!! We are Owen Chestnut and Kyra Fox, and we are the founders of SongStars.
                We both share a passion for music and love talking about music, but felt there wasn't a platform to do
                so.
                Thus, we decided to make one ourselves. We hope you enjoy it as much we do! </p>
